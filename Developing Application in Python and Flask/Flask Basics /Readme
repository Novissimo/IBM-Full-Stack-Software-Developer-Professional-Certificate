Use the following command to run the server from the terminal:
flask --app server --debug run

You should now be able to use the CURL command on localhost:5000/. Note that the terminal is already running the server, 
you can use the Split Terminal button to split the terminal and run the following command in the second tab.
curl -X GET -i -w '\n' localhost:5000
